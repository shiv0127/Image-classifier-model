# Image-classifier-model
An Image Classifier API using FastAPI and scikit-learn to classify images into categories. It preprocesses images (grayscale, resize, flatten), trains an SVM model, and provides a /predict/ endpoint to upload images and get predicted classes with confidence scores. Ideal for simple image categorization tasks.
